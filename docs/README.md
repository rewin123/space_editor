# Editor UI

For a quick overview of the editor's user interface and keyboard shortcuts, please refer to the [shortcuts.md](/docs/shortcuts.md) file.

The Editor UI is built upon the [edui_dock](https://github.com/Adanos020/egui_dock) crate. It offers a highly flexible and efficient way to interact with your Bevy projects. Here are some key features of the Editor UI:

## Tab-Based Organization

Most editor features are implemented as tabs within the dock system, providing a structured and organized workspace. You can easily manage these tabs to suit your workflow:

- **GameView Tab**: This tab displays the rendered output from the editor camera and gizmos for manipulate objects.
  - On the top left side of the Gameview you will find some relevant information like frames per second count (FPS), available editor tools and the selected tool options.
  - Currently the only available tool is Gizmo.

- **Hierarchy Tab**: The Hierarchy tab provides comprehensive information about all entities within your prefab. It not only displays entity details but also allows you to perform various actions:
  - Create new entities
  - Delete or clone existing entities (Right click on the entity)
  - Add child entity to existing entity.
  - Clear scene from all entities button.
  - Spawn [bundles](#bundles) (entities with preset components) for quick scene setup.

- **Inspector Tab**: The Inspector tab is your go-to place for inspecting and modifying components and their values. It empowers you to:
  - View detailed information about each component
  - Manipulate component values
  - Add or remove components as needed.
 
### Gizmos
- The gizmos tool contains (from left to right):
  - Translation option, that allows you to change the position of an object in the scene.

  - Rotation option, that allows you to change the orientation of an object in the scene.

  ![Rotation Gizmo Image](imgs/rotation_gizmo.png)

  - Scale option, that allows you to change the size of an object in the scene.

  ![Scale Gizmo Image](imgs/scale_gizmo.png)

> OBS: To apply a gizmos to multiple selected entities **holding SHIFT** is required

### Additional Tabs

> Additional tabs can be found by pressing `+` next to the existing tabs. Docking system is available to move tabs to your preferred position.

- **Settings Tab**: Your place to configure and customize the editor as you wish.
  - Undo chain size condiguration.
  - Hotkeys configuration
  - New tab spawning behavior:
    - **Same Node**: Adds the new tab as part of the current node.

    ![Same Node](imgs/samenode.png)

    - **New Window**: Creates a new floating window containing the tab.

    ![New Window](imgs/newwindow.png)

    - **Split Node**: Splits node in half.

    ![Split Node](imgs/splitnode.png) 

- **Resources Tab**: An inspector like tab to manage your resources data.
- **Debug World Inspector Tab**: An all in one tab.:
  - Manages Entities, including editor entities, and their components.
  - Resources tab.
  - Assets tab, currently the only way to access assets.
- **Event Dispatcher**: And inspector that shows a list of custom events to trigger in editor mode.

![Event Dispatcher](imgs/event_dispatcher.png)
`cargo run --release --example custom_event`

> Tabs organization is persisted

## Dock System Flexibility

The dock system in the Editor UI offers a high degree of flexibility:

- You can easily move tabs around, grouping them as necessary.

- Tabs can be hidden using the 'x' button, and you can reopen closed tabs with the '+' button, ensuring a clutter-free workspace.

- For added convenience, tabs can also be detached from the main dock system and placed in subwindows, allowing you to arrange your workspace exactly the way you prefer.

## Menu Toolbars

### Bottom menu

![bot_menu.png](https://github.com/rewin123/space_editor/blob/main/docs/imgs/bot_menu.png)

Bottom menu is panel with settings for current scene. It contains:

- "Clear Entities" button to remove all user added entities
- "Add Entity" button to add a new empty entity to the scene
- "Spawn Bundle" button to spawn a pre configured bundle in the scene:
  - 2D and 3D Meshes
  - 2D and 3D Cameras
  - Light
  - Sprites
- "Show editor entities" checkbox to show all editor hidden entities
- "Current Scene", label with the current scene name and path

### Top Menu
![top_menu.png](https://github.com/rewin123/space_editor/blob/main/docs/imgs/top_menu.png)

Top menu is panel with scene management options. It contains:

- Folder button to open file dialog to select prefab
- "Save" button to save scene manually in file dialog
- "Load" button to load scene from from file dialog
- "Open GLTF" button to load a GLTF/GLB as prefab
- Play button to starty play game

# Customization

## Register new component

Custom types can be added to the editor gui and prefab spawn system with just a single line:

```rs
use editor::prelude::EditorRegistryExt;

app.editor_registry::<Name>();
```

The representation of components in the editor UI can also be customized by bevy_inspector_egui library.

## Register new event

Custom Events can be added to the editor UI with the following:

```rs
#[derive(Event, Default, Resource, Reflect, Clone)]
#[reflect(Resource)]
pub struct Name;

use editor::prelude::EditorRegistryExt;

app.editor_registry_event::<Name>();
```

One limitation is that events must implement `Event, Default, Resource, Reflect, Clone`, with `Resource` reflected. Once registered, events can be sent using the `Event Dispatcher` tab.

> Obs: editor already handles internally objects registration and initialization:
> 
> `register_type::<T>() and init_resource::<T>()`

> To disable this, use feature `no_event_registration`.

## Bundles

Bundles in the Space Editor are predefined sets of components that simplify the creation of entities. When a bundle is spawned by button clicking in ui, the editor automatically generates a new entity with the components specified in the bundle. To make bundles accessible in the editor UI, you can register them using the `app.editor_bundle(category, name, bundle_components_set)` method. All bundles are showen in down of Hierarchy tab.

### Example: Adding a Cube Mesh Bundle

This example demonstrates how to add a bundle for a cube mesh:

```rust
app.editor_bundle("Mesh", "Cube", (
	MeshPrimitivePrefab::Cube(1.0),
	Name::new("Cube".to_string()),
	Transform::default(),
	Visibility::default()
));
```

And after call method, "Cube" bundle can be accessed in UI

## Add New Tab to Editor UI

In space_editor, you have two methods for adding new tabs to the editor user interface:

### Trait-Based Tab

Trait-based tabs are implemented by conforming to the `EditorTab` trait. These tabs provide full access to the Bevy world, enabling you to perform various tasks within the editor. To create a trait-based tab, you need to implement two functions:

1. `fn ui(&mut self, ui: &mut egui::Ui, world: &mut World)`: This function is responsible for rendering the tab's content. It grants you access to the Bevy world for any necessary operations.

2. `fn title(&self) -> egui::WidgetText`: Use this function to set the title of your tab.

To register a trait-based tab, follow this syntax:

```rust
app.editor_tab_by_trait(EditorTabName::Other(your_tab_id_string), your_tab);
```

### System-Based Tab

System-based tabs are another way to define tabs. You can create a tab from a Bevy system that utilizes the `EditorUiRef` non-send resource to display its content. This method provides a straightforward way to access world data for your tab. For example, you can create a tab using the following system:

```rust
fn simple_tab_system(mut ui : NonSendMut<EditorUiRef>) {
    let ui = &mut ui.0;
    ui.label("Hello editor");
}
```

To register a system-based tab, you can use this syntax:

```rust
app.editor_tab(EditorTabName::Other("simple_tab".to_string()), "Simnple tab".into(), simple_tab_system)
```

Result:

These approaches allow you to extend the space_editor's functionality by adding custom tabs tailored to your specific needs.
